constraints:
  -- big breaking change here, inline-r doens't have an upper bound
  singletons < 3.0
  -- bizarre issue: in earlier versions they define their own 'GEq', in newer
  -- ones they reuse the one from 'some', but there isn't e.g. a proper version
  -- constraint from dependent-sum-template (which is the library we actually use).
  , dependent-sum > 0.6.2.0
  -- Newer Hashable have instances for Set, which breaks beam-migrate
  -- which declares its own instances of Hashable Set
  , hashable < 1.3.4.0

-- See the note on nix/pkgs/default.nix:agdaPackages for why this is here.
-- (NOTE this will change to ieee754 in newer versions of nixpkgs).

-- These packages appear in our dependency tree and are very slow to build.
-- Empirically, turning off optimization shaves off ~50% build time.
-- It also mildly improves recompilation avoidance.
-- For deve work we don't care about performance so much, so this is okay.
