{-# INLINABLE validate #-}
-- | Validation script for monetary policy.
--
-- We allow user to forge coins just in two cases:
--
-- * mint new aTokens in exchange for real tokens on deposit to lending app
-- * burn aTokens on withdraw from lending app
--
-- For mint case we check that:
--
-- * user deposit has grown properly on user's internal wallet for lending pool state
-- * user has paid enough real tokens to get aTokens
-- * script has paid enough aTokens to user in return
--
-- For burn case we check that:
--
-- * user deposit has diminished properly on user's internal wallet for leding pool state
-- * script has paid enough real tokens to the use rin return
--
-- Note that during burn user does not pay aTokens to the app they just get burned.
-- Only app pays to user in compensation for burn.
