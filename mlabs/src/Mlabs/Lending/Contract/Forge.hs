{-# INLINEABLE validate #-}

{- | Validation script for minting policy.

 We allow user to forge coins just in two cases:

 * mint new aTokens in exchange for real tokens on deposit to lending app
 * burn aTokens on withdraw from lending app

 For mint case we check that:

 * user deposit has grown properly on user's internal wallet for lending pool state
 * user has paid enough real tokens to get aTokens
 * script has paid enough aTokens to user in return

 For burn case we check that:

 * user deposit has diminished properly on user's internal wallet for lending pool state
 * script has paid enough real tokens to the user in return

 Note that during burn user does not pay aTokens to the app they just get burned.
 Only app pays to user in compensation for burn.
