{- | Scene is users with balances and value that is owned by application script.
 It can be built with Monoid instance from parts with handy functions:

 'owns', 'apOwns', 'appAddress'

 With monoid instance we can specify only differences between test stages
 and then add them app with @<>@ to the initial state of the scene.
